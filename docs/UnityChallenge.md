# DALI Unity Challenge 🕶

## Overview
AR/VR has been on the rise and if you're interested in this type of fun, this is the perfect challenge for you! You will be using __Unity3D__ to create a project and show us something cool!

## Objective 
In this challenge, you will use [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) to create a Unity app. This could mean a 2D/3D game, AR app, VR app, or anything else along these lines. The contents of the app is completely up to you -- be creative! 😉

## Instructions 📋
1. Decide whether you want to tackle a 2D/3D game, AR app, or VR app.
2. Complete the __Setup__ section below.
3. Import some assets, make some objects, write some scripts, and have some fun!

## Setup ❗❗
### Unity Basic Setup (must do!)
1. Make a Unity account and download [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).
2. Use any Unity version you would like. If you are unsure about which version to use, we would recommend going to [Unity's download archives](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) and downloading version __Unity 2019.4.17__ to Unity Hub.
3. In Unity Hub, create a new project with the template __Universal Render Pipeline__.

### AR/VR Quest Setup (if applicable)
1. In Unity, go to `File -> Build Settings` and change the platform to `Android`.
2. Go to `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player`. Underneath `Android Settings -> Other Settings`:
    __i.__ Make sure the __Minimum API Level__ is `Android 4.4 KitKat`.
    __ii.__ Under __Graphics API__, remove `Vulcan`. 
3. Go to `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player`. Underneath `Android Settings -> XR Settings`: 
    __i.__ Check `Virtual Reality Supported`.
    __ii.__ Under __Virtual Reality SDKs__, make sure to check `V2 Signing (Quest)` under __Oculus__.
4. Go to the Unity [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) and install and import `Oculus Integration`.


### AR/VR Tools (if applicable)
1. __Vuforia__ is a SDK (Software Development Kit) for creating AR apps in Unity. Documentation and installation instructions can be found [here](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/getting-started-with-vuforia-in-unity.html).
2. __ARKit__ is Apple's version for creating AR apps in Unity. Documentation found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arkit@4.1/manual/).
3. __ARCore__ is Google's version! Here's the [resources](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/quickstart-android)!
4. Feel free to use the Unity [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) to import free assets into your project -- just make sure to credit it! 🙉

## Tips
* We are looking for an app that is functional and demonstrates understanding of Unity basics and C# scripting!
* Unity is a very powerful software that has a wide range of tools and applications. It might be a good idea to focus on a few elements that you are most interested in that demonstrate your skills. Some elements might include networking, animation with scripts, generative design, object interactions, physics systems, shaders, particle systems, etc.


## Some Random Project Ideas 👽
* 3D data visualization
* Storytelling through a 2D platformer
* Exploring virtual environments
* Here is an [example](https://github.com/songjon93/Dashboard_DALI) of a past project!

Make something fun and interesting! The more creative you get with this challenge, the better! If you have any questions feel free to email the DALI Lab. Good luck 🚀
